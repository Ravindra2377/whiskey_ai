## How to Run NEXUS

### Prerequisites
- Java 11 or higher
- Maven 3.6 or higher
- Spring Boot 2.7.x

### Running NEXUS Service
1. Navigate to the `nexus` directory:
   ```
   cd nexus
   ```

2. Build the service:
   ```
   mvn clean package
   ```

3. Run the service:
   ```
   java -jar target/nexus-1.0.0.jar
   ```

   Or use the provided batch script:
   ```
   run-nexus.bat
   ```

### Running with the Parent Project
1. From the root directory, you can build both modules:
   ```
   mvn clean package
   ```

2. Run the backend service:
   ```
   cd backend
   java -jar target/backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
   ```

3. Run the NEXUS service:
   ```
   cd nexus
   java -jar target/nexus-1.0.0.jar
   ```

## Security
NEXUS enforces strict policies through its Policy Engine to ensure safe operations. All tasks are validated before execution. Only ADMIN users can interact with NEXUS through the Boozer backend.

## Integration with Boozer Application
NEXUS integrates with the existing Boozer application through REST APIs. ADMIN users can access NEXUS functionality through the admin dashboard.

## Monitoring and Maintenance
NEXUS includes built-in monitoring and autonomous maintenance capabilities. The system continuously monitors its own health and performance, and can perform self-optimization tasks.

## Extending NEXUS
To extend NEXUS functionality:
1. Add new task types to the WhiskeyTask enum
2. Implement new agent classes for specific capabilities
3. Update the WhiskeyOrchestrator to handle new task types
4. Add new REST endpoints as needed
