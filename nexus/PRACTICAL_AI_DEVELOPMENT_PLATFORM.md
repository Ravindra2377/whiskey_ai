3. **Technical Support Service** - Automated ticket processing and solution generation
4. **AI Model Management** - Storage and management of trained AI models
5. **Client Tenant Management** - Isolated environments for each enterprise client

### Specialized AI Agent Framework

We've implemented an extensible framework for specialized AI agents:

```java
public abstract class SpecializedAIAgent {
    protected String domain;
    protected AIModel model;
    protected String knowledgeBase;
    
    public abstract TechnicalSolution generateSolution(
        TechnicalTicket ticket, IssueClassification classification);
    
    public abstract boolean canHandle(IssueClassification classification);
}
```

Currently implemented agents include:
- **DatabaseSpecialistAgent** - SQL optimization and performance tuning
- **CloudInfrastructureAgent** - Cloud resource optimization and cost management
- **SecurityAnalysisAgent** - Vulnerability assessment and security recommendations
