## 📁 Technical Implementation Details

### Dream Coding Service
The [DreamCodingService](file:///d:/OneDrive/Desktop/Boozer_App_Main/whiskey/src/main/java/com/boozer/whiskey/enhanced/DreamCodingService.java#L16-L184) enables 24/7 development productivity through background task processing:
- Tasks are queued for processing during idle periods
- Results are stored and can be retrieved by user ID
- Uses scheduled execution to process tasks without impacting system performance

### Predictive Vulnerability Scanner
The [PredictiveVulnerabilityScanner](file:///d:/OneDrive/Desktop/Boozer_App_Main/whiskey/src/main/java/com/boozer/whiskey/enhanced/PredictiveVulnerabilityScanner.java#L18-L496) predicts security vulnerabilities before they exist:
- Analyzes code patterns to identify potential future security issues
- Combines current vulnerability detection with predictive analysis
- Provides time-to-exploit estimates for predicted vulnerabilities

### Code DNA Sequencer
The [CodeDNASequencer](file:///d:/OneDrive/Desktop/Boozer_App_Main/whiskey/src/main/java/com/boozer/whiskey/enhanced/CodeDNASequencer.java#L18-L746) uses genetic algorithms to evolve your codebase:
- Implements self-optimizing code through evolutionary algorithms
- Applies mutations and crossover operations to improve code quality
- Optimizes for performance, maintainability, security, reliability, and testability
