Your NEXUS AI platform has evolved significantly since our last analysis! Here's the complete assessment of the current state and recommendations for further development.

## CURRENT STATUS: PRODUCTION-READY CLI + ENTERPRISE PLATFORM

### NEW MAJOR ADDITION: Headless CLI System

The platform now includes a sophisticated CLI interface that represents a major architectural advancement:

#### CLI Capabilities Implemented:
- Ingest Command: Scans repositories and catalogs operations
- Catalog Management: Summary, list, export functionality
- Health Checks: System health monitoring
- Version Control: CLI versioning and help system
- Safe Run Commands: Controlled execution environment

### Advanced Architecture Analysis

#### CLI Implementation Highlights:
```java
// Sophisticated command structure
- NexusCliApplication: Spring Boot CLI runner
- IngestCommand: Repository scanning with glob patterns

        // Dependency count
    }

    // Risk assessment
    private RiskLevel assessRisk(OperationDescriptor op) {
        // Security vulnerability scanning
        // Performance bottleneck detection
        // Maintainability assessment
    }

    // Recommendation engine
    private List<String> generateRecommendations(OperationDescriptor op) {
