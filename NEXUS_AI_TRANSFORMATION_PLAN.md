# NEXUS AI Transformation Plan

## Executive Summary
NEXUS AI is evolving from a headless CLI toolkit into a voice-driven, analytics-rich, enterprise automation platform. This plan captures the current system snapshot, articulates the north-star architecture, and details the phased roadmap to deliver voice assistant capabilities, predictive intelligence, and enterprise-grade integrations over the next 12 months.

## Current Baseline (Q3 2025)
- **Core runtime**: Java 11 + Spring Boot CLI profile (no web server) packaged via Maven.
- **Commands**: `health`, `version`, `ingest`, `catalog`, `run`, `nl`, `suggest`, `refactor`, `analytics`, `voice` (stub), with catalog-driven automation and dry-run protections.
- **Artifacts**: `operations-catalog.json` (ingest output), helper scripts (`run-discover.ps1`, `run-voice-demo.ps1`).
- **Observations**:
  - Natural language (`nl`) and `voice` commands act as thin shims; production-level intent parsing and speech services are outstanding.
  - Analytics provide descriptive insights only; predictive forecasts and dashboards are future work.
  - No persistent storage, REST surface, or plugin system yet; operations are stateless and file-based.

## Target Architecture
Refer to the user-supplied platform diagram (User Interface ↔ Voice Assistant ↔ CLI Core ↔ AI Analytics ↔ Enterprise Hub ↔ Databases/External APIs). Key architectural pillars:
1. **Voice Assistant Layer**: Wake-word listener, Whisper-powered STT, intent parser, TTS feedback.
2. **CLI Core & Command Set**: Command registry and execution sandbox, now extended via plugin interfaces.
3. **AI Analytics Fabric**: Stream processing of telemetry, predictive models, and visual dashboards.
4. **Enterprise Hub**: REST API gateway, plugin loader, persistence (PostgreSQL/MongoDB), tenancy controls.
5. **Integration Plane**: Database(s), external APIs, CI/CD toolchains.

## Roadmap Overview
| Phase | Timeline | Theme | Outcomes | Success Metrics |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Phase 1** | Months 1-3 | Voice Assistant Foundation | Whisper integration, wake word + VAD, intent parser, CLI orchestration, basic TTS | >90% command recognition, <2s round-trip, voice coverage for all existing CLI commands |
| **Phase 2** | Months 4-6 | Advanced Analytics & UI | React live dashboard, WebSocket telemetry, enhanced catalog analytics, REST API layer | Dashboard latency <1s, predictive accuracy baselines, API coverage for 100% CLI actions |
| **Phase 3** | Months 7-9 | Enterprise Extensibility | Plugin SDK, module hot-loading, persistent catalog & history, authn/z foundations | Plugin load <2s, ACID catalog storage, RBAC with 3 default roles |
| **Phase 4** | Months 10-12 | AI & Production Hardening | GPT-assisted coding, ML-based predictive maintenance, observability & CI/CD, cloud deployment templates | MTTR <15m with monitoring, CI lead time <30m, 99.5% uptime simulation |

## Phase 1 Detailed Backlog (Voice Assistant Core)
- **STT Pipeline**
  - Build Whisper client (REST streaming + local fallback) with error handling & retries.
  - Implement adaptive buffering and noise cancellation (Java Sound API + VAD library).
- **Wake Word Service**
  - Start with lightweight keyword detection (Porcupine/Snowboy or custom energy threshold logic) and evolve to ML-based detection.
- **Command Parsing**
  - Expand regex-based templates into an intent classification model (DistilBERT or Rasa), mapping to CLI command structures with argument extraction.
  - Maintain context memory (last command, catalog path, default filters).
- **TTS Feedback Loop**
  - Integrate ElevenLabs/Azure TTS with SSML support and offline fallback via eSpeak/MaryTTS.
- **Voice UX**
  - Add configurable wake words, success/failure earcons, and conversation transcripts stored securely.
- **Metrics & Observability**
  - Measure end-to-end latency, transcription confidence, command success rate; expose via Prometheus endpoints for Phase 2 dashboard consumption.

## Phase 2 Highlights (Dashboards & Predictive Analytics)
- **Real-time Dashboard**: React + Vite front-end, WebSocket updates, charts for queue depth, command outcomes, latency buckets.
- **Predictive Insights**: Train models on operation history (duration, failure rates) to forecast risk; surface in CLI (`analytics predict`) and dashboard.
- **REST API**: Spring MVC controllers wrapping CLI command bus; JWT-secured endpoints; API docs via OpenAPI 3.
- **Cross-Platform Notifications**: Optional Slack/Teams webhooks for high-priority alerts.

## Phase 3 Highlights (Enterprise Integration)
- **Plugin System**: Leverage Spring`s `ApplicationContext` refresh / ServiceLoader to load signed JARs; define plugin manifest schema and capabilities (commands, analytics hooks, dashboards).
- **Persistence Layer**: JPA entities for operations, sessions, telemetry; Flyway migrations; multi-tenant schema or row-level security.
- **Security & SSO**: OAuth2/OpenID Connect with policy-based access control; encrypted secrets vault.

## Phase 4 Highlights (AI Assist & Productionization)
- **Generative Coding Assist**: GPT integration for summarizing catalog artifacts, generating boilerplate scripts, and explaining refactor findings.
- **Predictive Maintenance**: ML models predicting refactor urgency, test flake probability, infrastructure drift.
- **Ops Hardened Delivery**: GitHub Actions pipelines, artifact publishing, Helm charts / Terraform modules, blue/green deployment strategies.

## Feature Priority Matrix (Q4 2025)
| Feature | Business Impact | Technical Complexity | User Demand | Effort | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Voice Assistant Core | High | Medium | High | Medium | **9** |
| CI/CD Integration | High | Low | High | Low | **9** |
| Performance Monitoring | High | Low | High | Low | **9** |
| Real-time Dashboard | High | Low | Medium | Medium | **8** |
| Predictive Analytics | High | High | Medium | High | **8** |
| Advanced Code Analytics | Medium | High | Medium | High | 7 |
| Database Integration | Medium | Low | Medium | Low | 7 |
| Plugin Architecture | Medium | Medium | Low | Medium | 6 |
| Multi-language Support | Medium | Medium | Medium | Medium | 6 |
| Enterprise SSO | Low | Medium | Low | Low | 4 |

## Dependencies & Enablers
- **External Services**: OpenAI Whisper API (or self-hosted), TTS provider, hosting for dashboards (AWS/GCP/Azure).
- **Libraries**: Java Sound API, Picovoice Porcupine (wake word), Jackson, Spring WebFlux/WebSocket, React, D3, TensorFlow/Sklearn.
- **Infrastructure**: S3/Bucket for audio archives, Postgres for persistence, Prometheus/Grafana for metrics.

## Immediate Next Steps (Weeks 1-2)
1. **Voice MVP**: Replace simulated transcription with real Whisper API calls (feature flag), implement `--stt-provider` CLI flag.
2. **Intent Parser Upgrade**: Introduce configurable intent JSON mapping; add coverage for catalog filters and run confirmation flows.
3. **Telemetry Bootstrap**: Instrument CLI commands with Micrometer counters and histograms.
4. **CI Pipeline**: Publish GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/cli.yml`) to build CLI profile and archive jar on push.
5. **Documentation**: Expand README voice section, add API key setup guide, create plugin authoring draft doc.

## Risk & Mitigation Snapshot
- **API Costs/Availability**: Provide local Whisper fallback (CTranslate2) and caching of transcripts.
- **Security**: Encrypt audio logs, enforce least privilege for plugins, integrate vulnerability scanning into CI.
- **Adoption**: Ship guided onboarding (voice “tour”, dashboard demo data), maintain CLI parity for power users.

## Success Measures
- Voice NPS > 40 by Month 4 (internal dogfood).
- 80% of catalog operations executed via voice or NL by Month 6.
- Mean time between voice errors < 5 min by Month 9 (through monitoring + auto-recovery).
- 3 enterprise pilots live on multi-tenant deployment by Month 12.

---
This plan stays intentionally incremental: build the voice foundation first, layer predictive intelligence next, then deliver enterprise-grade extensibility and operations maturity. Adjust phase sequencing only if new business constraints or pilot feedback materially shift priorities.
