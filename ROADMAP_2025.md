## Immediate engineering tasks in this repo

- Finalize CLI tooling (done: ingest, catalog; next: run)
- Expand ingest heuristics and tagging (in progress)
- Wire OpenAPI docs for services
- Add test harness for CLI commands
- Package Windows and Docker distributions

See README for CLI usage. Use `run-discover.ps1` to build, ingest, and print a summary quickly on Windows.
