## Key Features Implemented

1. **Persistent Task Storage**: All tasks are stored in PostgreSQL with full lifecycle tracking
2. **Real-time Status Updates**: Task status changes are immediately reflected in the database
3. **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all AI operations for compliance and analysis
4. **Recovery Capabilities**: Tasks can be resumed after system restarts
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Connection pooling and efficient database access

## Database Schema

The integration creates a single table `nexus_tasks` with comprehensive tracking fields:
- Task identification and type
- Status and progress tracking
- Creation and modification timestamps
- User attribution

## How to Use

1. **Prerequisites**: Install PostgreSQL and create the database/user
2. **Configuration**: Update credentials in application.properties if needed
3. **Deployment**: Build and run NEXUS as usual
4. **Operation**: Use the API endpoints - database operations happen automatically

## Files Delivered

All implementation files, documentation, and tools have been created and verified:
- Source code components for database integration
- Comprehensive documentation
- Setup and testing scripts
- Distribution package

## Status

✅ **COMPLETE** - PostgreSQL integration is fully implemented and ready for use

The NEXUS AI system now has robust PostgreSQL database connectivity for persistent task management and comprehensive operational tracking.
